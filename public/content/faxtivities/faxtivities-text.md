# Faxtivities

Completed April 2020

## Background

*Faxtivities* is a piece of participatory art using GPT-2 and a few Python scripts to generate unique drawing prompts and fax them to participants, who then respond to the prompts and fax their drawings back to me. The final piece consisted of a collection of 20 drawings compiled from participants who had access to fax machines in quarantine. Some samples of this final set can be seen below.

The project evolved from my interest in figuring out what I could do with a fax machine. In a time when many of us were stuck in our homes and trying all sorts of ways of staying in touch with each other, I thought it was an apt opportunity to experiment with a tool for communication that, in all likelihood, is near the edge of extinction (at least in the United States). The project eventually moved beyond just faxing and began to ask a second question: what if a computer completely manages one side of the fax?

## Artistic Context

*Faxtivities* primarily pulls inspiration from the fax art of the 1980s (an example being the [*Global-Art-Fusion*](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kaii-higashiyama-global-art-fusion) project by Ueli Fuchser, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, and Kaii Higashiyama). Fax art was an early example of collaborative art that could be easily created and disseminated by and to parties across the world. It was one of the earliest forms of technology-assisted, visual, telematic art.

The concept for the AI-generated drawing prompts was inspired by two sources: [*Learning to Love You More*](http://learningtoloveyoumore.com/index.php), a piece created by Miranda July and Harrell Fletcher which asks its audience to respond to a list of assignments, and [*Billie Eilish Gets Interviewed by a Robot*](https://youtu.be/K0c94ghBS4A), created by Brook Linder, Taeko Masuyama, Lisa Romagnoli, and Nicole He for *Vogue*, a video in which Billie Eilish is interviewed using questions generated by a tweaked GPT-2 AI.

Synthesizing the concepts from these pieces of work led to a strange, almost anachronistic, mix of disparate technologies that became Faxtivities.
