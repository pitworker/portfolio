# Þúdiniska

Completed May 2021

## Background

I've had a long-held fascination with the grammar and sounds of the Icelandic language, as well as an interest in the history of the area in which it was spoken. Learning about the early Irish monks that inhabited Iceland before the arrival of the Vikings, I was curious what language a modern-day population descended from those early Irish settlers might have spoken if a Celtic society had a larger foothold in the area to develop alongside the surrounding Norse populations. This interest led me to create the fictional island of *Þúdinis* (transliterated into English as Thuidinis, translating roughly to "North Island"), a few miles to the southeast of modern day Iceland. Admittedly, the island was just an excuse for me to create the language *Þúdiniska*, a Celtic language with heavy Icelandic influences over its grammar and vocabulary.

## Influence

*Þúdiniska* is an Insular Celtic language descended from Old Irish with a heavy Norse influence from the nearby Icelandic language. While the word order and a majority of the language's lexicon follow from the language's Irish origin, many of the language's inflections, as well as a siginificant minority of the lexicon, betray the Norse hegemony in the area for most of the language's history.
