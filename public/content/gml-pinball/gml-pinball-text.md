# Google Marketing Live Pinball Machines

Installed May 2023

Created with Deeplocal for Google

## Overview

Google approached Deeplocal to create the centerpiece for its AI Pavilion at Google Marketing Live 2023. I was brought onto the project as software lead during the concept development phase and saw it through to the machines' permanent re-installation after the conclusion of the event. Over the course of six weeks, I led a team of three developers to build a game for a trio of bespoke pinball machines.

## Architecture and Process

Built in Unity on the Multimorphic pinball framework, the machines' software handled the game logic, scoring, timing, controls for all the machine's mechanical components and lighting, in-game animations, and the between-game resting state.

As software lead on the project, my primary focus was on software architecture, developing the game's state machine, high-score tracking, and game start/end mechanics, as well as overseeing the rest of the software development. I also acted as the onsite software developer for the project's installation and wrote any needed bug fixes during the testing and activation phases.
