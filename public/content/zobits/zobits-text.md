Awarded the 2021 Henry Armero Award for Creative Inclusivity

## Overview

*Zobits* is a creative toy that invites players to iteratively assemble and tweak digital ecosystems. *Zobits* consists of a set of sixteen plastic figures representing different ecological niches, a magnetic pad with recepticles for four figures, and a ocompanion Android app on which the player's biomes develop. As players select and palce organisms in each of the recepticles, those organisms begin spawning within the phone app. Over the course of a couple days, the ecosystem develops and evolves, with balanced groupings of organisms thriving and unbalanced systems slowly dying off.
