# Twisty Puzzles

## Background

I've been designing twisty puzzles* since I was in high school. The way these toys fuse simple geometric transformations with intricate mechanisms to produce wildly complex puzzles has always fascinated me. I began making these puzzles by hand by modifying the pieces of mass-produced puzzles, but after becoming acquainted with 3D printing, my designs started becoming increasingly elaborate.

*Twisty puzzles are mechanical puzzles similar to the Rubik's Cube.

## Professor Square-1

One of my favorite mass-produced puzzles for a long time has been the [Square-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-1_(puzzle)). It's among the most mechanically simple twisty puzzles in existence, yet it exhibits movement dynamics typical of far more complex puzzles. I was interested in exploring higher-order variants of the puzzle (think the 5-layer Professor Cube compared to the 3-layer Rubik's Cube), while keeping the basic properties of the puzzle as close to the original as possible, something that turns out to be surprisingly rare among comparable Square-1 variations.

Compared to the Square-1, this puzzle has two layers added across the vertical axis and 8 extra single-unit wedges added per layer. This achieves a puzzle that introduces many of the dynamics of similar higher-order puzzles (parity, internal layer ambiguity, etc), while carrying over nearly all of the basic geometric properties of the original.
