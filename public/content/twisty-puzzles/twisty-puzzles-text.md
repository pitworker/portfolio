# Twisty Puzzles

## Background

I've been designing twisty puzzles* since I was in high school. The way these toys fuse simple geometric transformations with intricate mechanisms to produce wildly complex puzzles has always fascinated me. I began making these puzzles by hand by modifying the pieces of mass-produced puzzles, but after becoming acquainted with 3D printing, my designs started becoming increasingly elaborate.

\*Twisty puzzles are mechanical puzzles similar to the *Rubik's Cube*.

## Professor Square-1

Completed 2016

One of my favorite mass-produced puzzles for a long time has been the [*Square-1*](https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=602) (originally called *Cube21*). It's among the most mechanically simple twisty puzzles in existence, yet it exhibits movement dynamics typical of far more complex puzzles. I was interested in exploring higher-order variants of the puzzle (think the 5-layer *Professor Cube* compared to the 3-layer *Rubik's Cube*), while keeping the basic properties of the puzzle as close to the original as possible, something that turns out to be surprisingly rare among comparable Square-1 variations.

Compared to the *Square-1*, this puzzle has two layers added across the vertical axis and 8 extra single-unit wedges added per layer. This achieves a puzzle that introduces many of the dynamics of similar higher-order puzzles (parity, internal layer ambiguity, etc), while carrying over nearly all of the basic geometric properties of the original.

## Offset Tetrahedron

I love tetrahedral puzzles. While I can't really explain why, I've just always found something about the way the shape fits in my hands alluring.

When designing the *Offset Tetrahedron*, I adapted the mechanism of David Pitcher's [*Face Turning Octahedron*](https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1663) to a tetrahedral shape,so half the rotating faces from the original puzzle were now vertices. By shifting the cut planes, I added a couple more visible pieces to the puzzle. By tilting the rotation axes slightly off-center, I created an asymetric geometry on each face. When scrambled, the resulting puzzle creates a chaos of pieces that obscures its simple solved shape.

Creating this puzzle introduced some new considerations I hadn't encountered in my previous puzzles. With a number of fully internal pieces, I had to be careful with how I choreographed the puzzle's cut rotations to keep from accidentally deleting the internal parts. The size of these internal pieces also required me to miniaturize the assemblies of screws and other metal hardware I typically use in my puzzles.
