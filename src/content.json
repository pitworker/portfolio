It's one of the most mechanically simple twisty puzzles I have encountered, yet it is also far harder to solve than many of the more mechanically complex puzzles are. Interested in making my own puzzle, I decided to make a variant of the Square-1 by taking further inspiration from the Professor Cube (a 5x5x5 variation of the normally 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube). In short, I added two extra layers to straight axis of the puzzle and added four more slices to the offset axis. This produces a puzzle that is very similar looking to the Square-1, but more complex mechanically and also more challenging to solve."

I took the internal mechanism, moved the cuts slightly to add a couple more pieces, then I transformed the octahedron into a tetrahedron. Unsatisfied with what I had created (I'd inadvertantly recreated a Master Tetrahedron), I offset all the cuts in relation to the tetrahedron they were intersecting. This not only made the puzzle more interesting, but it resulted in a puzzle that becomes complete chaos when it is scrambled, which I significantly enjoyed."

In the Offset Tetrahedron, though, there is a significant number of pieces housed within the puzzle that can never be seen when the puzzle is fully assembled. They are vital to the puzzle's function, but they remain invisible. Figuring out how to cut the puzzle apart in a way that preserved these internal pieces was something new for me."

Unlike spoken language, which evolves naturally, writing systems are invented and standardized. They often go unchanged, even as languages evolve, resulting in spelling that could depart significantly from the pronunciation of the word (caught and cot could be pronounced the same or differently depending on where in the US you live).\nInterested in thinking about English spelling in a different way, I worked on creating a phonetic writing system for the English language. In addition to making the writing system phonetically represent English as I pronounced it, rather than the only semi-phonetic spelling that currently exists, I chose to make the writing system an abugida as opposed to an alphabet. In an abugida, words are spelled with consonant bases that are modified with vowels. This would save space and make a writing system that is more visually efficient."

To emphasize these pairs, a number of the consonants in the writing system are different only by a voicing mark that is added to differentiate them.\nYou may also notice that there are more consonants and vowels here than are in the current English alphabet. This is because we actually have more sounds in our language than we do in our alphabet. Some letters represent multiple different sounds or combine with other letters to represent new sounds.

It senses when a lollipop is placed into it, and, using a sponge wetted from a trough of water, licks the lollipop until it is just a stick. The intentional lack of a runoff collection system leads to a pool of liquid lollipop to collect around the robot all over the table the robot is on. The entire project was inspired by my partner, Paul, and me finding an orange sponge at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pccr.org/\">Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse</a>."

The line explored multiple different concepts: the intersection of the organic with the inorganic, forms that reveal themselves when viewed at multiple angles, and the idea of personal space. Using flat, rigid, and inorganic materials, I constructed organic, wearable forms. The layering technique used allowed the looks to give very different impressions when viewed from the front or back than when viewed from the sides. From some angles, the outfits hide most of the body, while from others, they reveal the body underneath; each look features spikes, that while they look elegant, also announce to viewers to keep their distance.<br /><br />The line was featured in Lunar Gala in 2018, Carnegie Mellon's premiere student fashion show, and Pittsburgh's largest fashion event."

From these eight sketches, I chose the four that I felt were the strongest. My next task was to figure out how to make the outfits stay together and be wearable. The outfits needed to be taken off and put on easily, as the models would be featured in other lines in the show. The outfits needed to be comfortable enough to walk in. They also needed to be adjustable to account for measurement tolerance and the fact that the models' bodies might change over time.\n\nUltimately, I settled on a system of two plastic rings inside the outfits, connecting all the layers of outer material. Each of these rings supported a strap that could be tightened or loosened to adjust to the model's body. The rings also split in half so the outfit can be taken off the model."

The tape-measure typically used in fashion design proved to messy for what I needed to do, so I resorted to 3D-scanning my models. I took hundreds of photos at different angles of each model, ran the photos through Agisoft Photoscan, and produced rough 3D models or each model. I then modelled the outfits directly on top of these 3D models.\n\nThe rings were 3D-printed, and the flat layers were cut on a CNC mill. I initially intended to make the layers out of transparent, colored acrylic. The acrylic proved to be far too expensive incredibly heavy. I ended up replacing the acrylic with white Gator Foam (similar to foamcore but far more rigid). After being cut and printed, all the pieces were glued and press-fit together by hand."

Under these premises, I proposed a guided tour around campus that creates a path for the visitor based on interests that the visitor selects, but also allows visitors to learn about other parts of campus if they walk by something that grabs their attention.\n\nI wanted to focus on a couple things with the tour: allowing the visitor to select their own interests and tailoring a tour to those interests, giving personal student perspectives to the visitor, and allowing the user to know if there is information available that isn't part of their specific tour."

Last year, the campus tour was redesigned to be more personal to the student tour guide’s experience. The goal was to give a more personal perspective on the school that a visitor wouldn’t be able to otherwise get from a visit to the school’s website or a self-guided tour. Student tour guides submit their own scripts and points of interest on campus and give a tour that is entirely about their own experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in an attempt to make the tour more personal, the tours have become much less informative. The tour barely shows you the campus, and the guides give very little history about the school or about opportunities available that do not pertain to their life on campus. A student visiting who is interested in business wouldn’t be able to glean much about the major they are interested in from a tour guide who studies art, for example.<br /><br />Alternatively, the self-guided tour gives the visitors a decent amount of information about nearly every location on campus and a map, so the visitor has the ability to visit any of these buildings to see the spaces they might occupy in the future. The self-guided tour, though, dumps a nearly overwhelming amount of information on the visitor and asks them to parse through the information themselves. Furthermore, the self-guided tour gives almost nothing with regards to an actual student’s perspective.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTgvMDkvMTgvOGtxZWM1bzZldl9XYWxraW5nX1RvdXJfTWFwX1NlcHQyMDE4LnBkZiJdXQ/Walking_Tour_Map_Sept2018.pdf\"> The current self-guided tour can be found here.</a>"

Buildings of note are highlighted with a red outline and text information is displayed in space near the building.\n\nIn the same storyboard, I also toyed with the idea of having an avatar present the information by speaking to the person on the tour. This would not only create a more personal experience, but it would provide an avenue through which a personal perspective could be shared. This avatar also acts as a tour guide and directs the visitor around campus. At this point I also thought about synchronizing the experience so a group of people visiting campus together could experience the same augmented reality tour."

The tour then directs the visitor around, again by placing arrows on the ground. Added to the new tour, though, is a contextual text box, locked to a position within the viewer’s field of vision rather than a position in the real world, that tells the visitor where they are being directed.\n\nLike the previous iteration, buildings and points of interest are highlighted with a red outline. Rather than an avatar tour guide that stays in the tour the whole time (like the second version of the previous iteration), the avatar only pops up when a student perspective is being presented.\n\nAdded to this iteration is the ability to point to buildings unrelated to the tour and get some basic information about them. This would allow the visitor to learn about the place they are looking at without it detracting too much from the tour. If the visitor wants to actually visit that place, they can add it to their tour."

Having information just pop up while a person is walking might be jarring, and making sure the person notices that there is something to learn in a spot might be challenging without some sort of indication beforehand, unless the tour specifically told them to stop and look in a certain direction at every point where there is information, which might be overkill. Furthermore, it might be hard for the visitor to know which non-tour things on campus are worthy of pointing to and gleaning information and which are not."

Circles are red when the information is relevant to the interests they selected, and grey when the information is not relevant. All locations that have information display circles of either red or grey, this way, the visitor can distinguish what is relevant to them while still being able to learn about things they see and are curious about. When a circle is selected, a student avatar will appear to give information to the visitor. When the person appears, so does another icon: a small red circle with an X on it. The visitor can point to this icon to make the avatar disappear if they do not want to see it."

I was trying to figure out a way of representing what type of content the location was going to reveal, as I had decided that different categories of content would be displayed in different ways (only student testimonies would actually be presented by a student talking, while other information would be presented as text).\n\nMy first thought was to have only one type of content located at each circle and then an icon to indicate the type of content that is located there. I decided this wasn’t a good idea because there would be locations where multiple different categories can be talked about, and I thought it would be messy to have a bunch of circles near each other.\n\nNext I thought of having text be revealed when the visitor initially points to the circle. A text element would also appear above the circle telling the visitor where they were. Just showing text was a little unintuitive for something that was supposed to be selected by a finger in space, so I needed to do something else.\n\nI thought about having icons appear around the circle when the circle is pointed to. These would more clearly be buttons to select, and the visitor would learn what kind of content is implied by the icons as they are guided around the campus and interact with these icons more.\n\nWhen a student is talking and gestures to a specific item in the space, in addition to pointing, that space is highlighted. Given the challenge of highlighting movable objects, it is likely that this would only work for static things, but I figured that in most cases, it would only be static things that are being highlighted by students.\n\nI also prototyped what would happen when the user selects the X to end an interaction with a student testimony. I thought to have the student twist and shrink into the background. This would give a sense of space and get rid of the student in a way that wasn’t too jarring.\n\nNavigation across campus was still done with an arrow on the ground in this version.\n\nWhen a circle for an entire building is selected in this version, it is highlighted and some basic information is given about it with a button to reveal more information."

I initially came up with 10 categories based on questions I thought that the personas I had created would ask, but by consolidating a few into each other, I ended up with six final categories: finances, student life, classes, general information, jobs/after school/research, infrastructure. I came up with icons that could represent each of these categories.\n\nSecond, I thought about how interaction with the circle would work. First I thought of different shapes for the circles. Then I thought about how the icons would be revealed when the circle is selected. The icons could either be revealed within a larger circle, the icon currently being selected highlighted, or the icons could just float around the circle and be boxed in when selected.\n\nI deliberately decided to depart from the conventions of the Hololens, as I was trying to design an interface that was more comfortable to use. When using the Hololens, I hated the interaction of having to pinch to select UI elements. With better hand tracking technology (such as that in a leap motion), I figured I could use more comfortable interactions. I opted to have the user quickly bend their pointer finger to select a circle. Then with the selected, a series of flicks select the category from the circle (this was never prototyped but it is shown in the final video)."

I settled on using a combination of the two, but only using arrows on the ground when absolutely necessary. Arrows would be used when the correct path could not be found otherwise."

Since I figured that the students giving personal perspectives would be locked to the world, but text elements would be locked to the gaze, they needed different ways of being exited. Originally I thought I could keep an X to exit both of them, but ultimately I decided that the X was not ideal in either situation.\n\nFor the text, I settled on a swipe to get rid of it. I felt this reflected a more visceral interaction in physical space, something I thought would be better for an AR experience. Again, this was not prototyped, but it is shown in the final video.\n\nFor the student story, since the student was locked to an actual physical location rather than the gaze, I also had freedom to use the viewer’s gaze as an interactive element. Rather than swiping the person away, which is something you would never do to a real person, I thought it would be better to have the viewer simply look away. As the user turns their head away from the student, the student’s voice becomes quieter. Once the voice gets quieted to the point where it is inaudible, the student is no longer projected. This decrease in volume is not linked to head movement (as that might require the visitor to turn their head 180 degrees to quiet the student, for example). Instead, the student is quieted by the amount of time the user has not been looking at the student. This was also not prototyped, but it was shown (without sound) in the video."

In all my early mechanism, the rubberband's force was being applied directly against the hand's motion.\n\nAbout midway through my experimentation with mechansims, I began trying to experiment with interactions where the rubberband was pulling along a different axis than the user. My first attempt at this featured a folded cardstock object that the user would push. The cardstock would pop back into its original shape when released, actuated by a rubberband on the underside of the cardstock that would pull in horizontally, pushing the center fold up when it tightened.\n\nMy next iteration featured a wood piece that was pushed and pulled horizontally by the user. The piece had notches in it, which would pop a dowel attached to a rubberband up and down. This produced a clicking sound while pulled. I really liked this interaction, so I took the same principle and experimented with a couple other motions: another push/pull, just held a different way, a switch-like interaction, and a twisting interaction. The twisting was nice because it didn't have a beginning or end, it could be used continuously. I sketched out schematics for these mechanisms as I was trying to create them in order to plan out what I was putting together.\n\nI liked the twisting, but I wanted to make the clicking mechanism in it more prominent, so I made another version. The new version featured deeper grooves on an inner wheel, and the inner wheel was also made from basswood instead of balsa wood. The new version (which ended up being my final) was also significantly larger and looked the same from sides (I wanted to emphasize the fact that the interaction does not have a real beginning or end)."

I considered objects that sat on a table or a wall, objects that were held in one hand and twisted in the other, and objects that were twisted with both hands. I figured that items held the same way in each hand were the most visually pleasing and served the concept behind my interaction the best.\n\nI began working on the physical models by gripping clay to see where fingers would come into contact with a basic cylinder. Using these clay forms, I began experimenting with different geometry to fit to the grip. I found that hexagonal shapes struck a good balance between being a good shape for the hand and being visually simple. I also found that sloped shapes fit well.\n\nWith vertical edges, though, there was little indication as to how someone was supplosed to interact with the form. Taking this into account, I twisted the edges of the form so to indicate a rotational movement.\n\nAfter settling on this object for the twisting pieces, I experimented a little bit with size and proportion before making my final model."

Under the fungus's command, the ant strays from its normal habitat and attaches itself to the undersude of a leaf; at which point the fungus kills the ant and begins sprouting from the ant's head. As the long stem grows, it spreads its spores to infect more ants.\n\nI was gripped by the reproductive cycle of the Cordyceps fungus. Its ability to control the mind of another organism and manipulate the ant's motion to its will is something straight out of a science fiction movie. I am always amazed by the unbelievable power that exists in nature that can often go unnoticed unless you watch closely.\n\nThis piece was completed in 2017 for the course BXA Seminar I."
