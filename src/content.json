It's one of the most mechanically simple twisty puzzles I have encountered, yet it is also far harder to solve than many of the more mechanically complex puzzles are. Interested in making my own puzzle, I decided to make a variant of the Square-1 by taking further inspiration from the Professor Cube (a 5x5x5 variation of the normally 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube). In short, I added two extra layers to straight axis of the puzzle and added four more slices to the offset axis. This produces a puzzle that is very similar looking to the Square-1, but more complex mechanically and also more challenging to solve."

I took the internal mechanism, moved the cuts slightly to add a couple more pieces, then I transformed the octahedron into a tetrahedron. Unsatisfied with what I had created (I'd inadvertantly recreated a Master Tetrahedron), I offset all the cuts in relation to the tetrahedron they were intersecting. This not only made the puzzle more interesting, but it resulted in a puzzle that becomes complete chaos when it is scrambled, which I significantly enjoyed."

In the Offset Tetrahedron, though, there is a significant number of pieces housed within the puzzle that can never be seen when the puzzle is fully assembled. They are vital to the puzzle's function, but they remain invisible. Figuring out how to cut the puzzle apart in a way that preserved these internal pieces was something new for me."

Unlike spoken language, which evolves naturally, writing systems are invented and standardized. They often go unchanged, even as languages evolve, resulting in spelling that could depart significantly from the pronunciation of the word (caught and cot could be pronounced the same or differently depending on where in the US you live).\nInterested in thinking about English spelling in a different way, I worked on creating a phonetic writing system for the English language. In addition to making the writing system phonetically represent English as I pronounced it, rather than the only semi-phonetic spelling that currently exists, I chose to make the writing system an abugida as opposed to an alphabet. In an abugida, words are spelled with consonant bases that are modified with vowels. This would save space and make a writing system that is more visually efficient."

To emphasize these pairs, a number of the consonants in the writing system are different only by a voicing mark that is added to differentiate them.\nYou may also notice that there are more consonants and vowels here than are in the current English alphabet. This is because we actually have more sounds in our language than we do in our alphabet. Some letters represent multiple different sounds or combine with other letters to represent new sounds.

It senses when a lollipop is placed into it, and, using a sponge wetted from a trough of water, licks the lollipop until it is just a stick. The intentional lack of a runoff collection system leads to a pool of liquid lollipop to collect around the robot all over the table the robot is on. The entire project was inspired by my partner, Paul, and me finding an orange sponge at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pccr.org/\">Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse</a>."

The line explored multiple different concepts: the intersection of the organic with the inorganic, forms that reveal themselves when viewed at multiple angles, and the idea of personal space. Using flat, rigid, and inorganic materials, I constructed organic, wearable forms. The layering technique used allowed the looks to give very different impressions when viewed from the front or back than when viewed from the sides. From some angles, the outfits hide most of the body, while from others, they reveal the body underneath; each look features spikes, that while they look elegant, also announce to viewers to keep their distance.<br /><br />The line was featured in Lunar Gala in 2018, Carnegie Mellon's premiere student fashion show, and Pittsburgh's largest fashion event."

From these eight sketches, I chose the four that I felt were the strongest. My next task was to figure out how to make the outfits stay together and be wearable. The outfits needed to be taken off and put on easily, as the models would be featured in other lines in the show. The outfits needed to be comfortable enough to walk in. They also needed to be adjustable to account for measurement tolerance and the fact that the models' bodies might change over time.\n\nUltimately, I settled on a system of two plastic rings inside the outfits, connecting all the layers of outer material. Each of these rings supported a strap that could be tightened or loosened to adjust to the model's body. The rings also split in half so the outfit can be taken off the model."

The tape-measure typically used in fashion design proved to messy for what I needed to do, so I resorted to 3D-scanning my models. I took hundreds of photos at different angles of each model, ran the photos through Agisoft Photoscan, and produced rough 3D models or each model. I then modelled the outfits directly on top of these 3D models.\n\nThe rings were 3D-printed, and the flat layers were cut on a CNC mill. I initially intended to make the layers out of transparent, colored acrylic. The acrylic proved to be far too expensive incredibly heavy. I ended up replacing the acrylic with white Gator Foam (similar to foamcore but far more rigid). After being cut and printed, all the pieces were glued and press-fit together by hand."
