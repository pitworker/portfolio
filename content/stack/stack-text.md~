# Stack

Completed February 2018

## Background

Between September 2017 and February 2018, I designed a four-piece line of wearable sculpture titled *Stack*. The line explored multiple different concepts: the intersection of the organic with the inorganic, forms that reveal themselves when viewed at multiple angles, and the idea of personal space. Using flat, rigid, and inorganic materials, I constructed organic, wearable forms. Layering rigid sheets allowed the looks to give very different impressions when viewed from the front or back than when viewed from the sides. From some angles, the outfits hide most of the body, while from others, they reveal the body underneath; each look features spikes, that while they look elegant, also announce to viewers to keep their distance.

The line was featured in Lunar Gala in 2018, Carnegie Mellon's premiere student fashion show, and Pittsburgh's largest fashion event.
