# zoöid

Completed March 2020

In collaboration with [Alice Fang](https://www.alicefang.me/) and [Connie Ye](https://connieye.com/).

## Background

*zoöid* is a line of networked wearable art inspired by deep-sea organisms that communicate with light. Each piece is equipped with LED lights powered by an Arduino. Using XBee radio transmitters, the pieces are able to communicate with each other and with a central computer in order to synchronize their patterns and rhythms.

We were interested in using these electronic formats to create a line of eight pieces that functioned as a single super-organism. We looked to pyrosomes in the depths of the ocean that use flashes of light to synchronize their movements. Despite being small organisms on their own, this ability to communicate allows the pyrosomes to work together and operate as a much larger organism. zoöid functions in much the same way on a stage, using synchronized light and choreography to transform 8 pieces of clothing into a single, fluid spectacle.

*zoöid* was designed and fabricated with my lovely partners, Connie Ye and Alice Fang, and was made possible by the generous support of CMU's competitive [SURG](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/academic-research/SURG/index.html#surg) and [FRFAF](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/grants) research grant programs. The line was presented in [Lunar Gala](https://www.lunargala.org), one of Pittsburgh's largest annual fashion events.
